# PowerShell
PS scripts - Various PS Scripts that I created for work or for fun. <br/>

<b>FOLDERS:</b><br/>
<b>SPO</b> - This is a small collection of SP scripts I created for managing SharePoint Online. <br/>
<b>SP2013</b> - This is a small colection of SP script that I created to help managing monitoring settings in SharePoint 2013<br/>
<b>Ninja PowerShell</b> - This is a large collection of PS scritpts that I created to test my theories about using parameter validation by using custom Attributes that marked the C# Cmndlts. My theory wa that by validating up-from and using a centralized set of validation Methods, validation would be faster, allowing PS scripts to run faster and have greater predictability and stability. <br/>
I was right. And from this work I wrote the best-selling Amazon book <a href='http://amzn.to/2anVl79'>Ninja PowerShell Secrets- Volume One - Centralized Input Validation in Cmdlet Code</a>.
